Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes {@dice 1d8} lightning damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier and it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save its speed is reduced to 0 until the spell ends. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal {@dice 1d8} lightning damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you."
